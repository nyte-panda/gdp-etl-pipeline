# gdp-etl-pipeline
This repository contains an automated ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline designed to extract GDP data of countries from Wikipedia, transform it to a more usable format, and load it into both a CSV file and an SQLite database. The data is sourced from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) report on countries' nominal GDP.
